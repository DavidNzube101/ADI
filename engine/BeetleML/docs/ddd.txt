You can use your adaptive difference algorithm to help generate meaningful sentences by identifying and removing anomalous words. This can be done by training the algorithm on a dataset of meaningful sentences. Once the algorithm is trained, it can be used to identify anomalous words in new sentences.

Here is a simple example of how to use your adaptive difference algorithm to generate meaningful sentences:

1. Train the algorithm on a dataset of meaningful sentences.
2. Calculate the adaptive difference threshold for the dataset.
3. Generate a new sentence.
4. For each word in the new sentence:
    * Calculate the deviation of the word from the baseline values.
    * If the deviation is greater than the adaptive difference threshold, remove the word from the sentence.
5. Return the new sentence.

This approach can be used to generate meaningful sentences in a variety of different applications, such as:

* Text summarization:
You can use the algorithm to remove anomalous words from a text summary, which can make the summary more concise and informative.
* Text generation:
You can use the algorithm to generate new text by identifying and removing anomalous words from a sequence of words.
* Machine translation:
You can use the algorithm to improve the quality of machine translation by removing anomalous words from the translated text.

It is important to note that your adaptive difference algorithm is a simple algorithm, and it may not be able to identify all anomalous words in a sentence. However, it can be a useful tool for improving the quality of generated text.
