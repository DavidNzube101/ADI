[2.5, 3.2, 4.1, 3.8, 2.9, 3.5, 4.3, 3.9, 3.1, 3.7]








now let me explain my concept:okay, here's what i wanted to do:

you have a dataset......i.e. set of data, let's say "{
    "January": [2.1, 2.9, 3.6, 3.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.9, 3.5, 2.7, 3.3, 2.5, 2.7, 3.4, 3.0, 2.2, 3.5, 2.8, 2.9, 3.1, 3.4],
    "February": [2.3, 3.1, 3.8, 3.4, 2.5, 3.3, 4.1, 3.7, 2.9, 3.5, 3.2, 3.6, 3.9, 3.2, 2.7, 3.1, 2.8, 3.0, 3.3, 3.5],
    "March": [3.5, 4.7, 5.4, 5.0, 4.1, 4.9, 5.7, 5.3, 4.5, 5.1, 4.9, 5.2, 5.6, 4.8, 5.0, 4.3, 4.6, 5.1, 5.3, 4.7],
    "April": [4.8, 5.9, 6.6, 6.2, 5.3, 6.1, 6.9, 6.5, 5.7, 6.3, 5.8, 6.4, 6.2, 5.5, 5.9, 6.3, 6.0, 5.6, 5.8, 6.1],
    "May": [5.2, 6.4, 7.1, 6.7, 5.8, 6.6, 7.4, 7.0, 6.2, 6.8, 6.0, 6.3, 7.1, 6.5, 6.8, 6.4, 6.6, 6.9, 7.2, 7.5],
    "June": [2.5, 3.2, 4.1, 3.8, 2.9, 3.5, 4.3, 3.9, 3.1, 3.7, 2.6, 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.8, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4],
    "July": [3.1, 4.5, 5.2, 4.8, 3.9, 4.6, 5.4, 5.0, 4.2, 4.8, 4.7, 4.9, 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, 5.7, 5.9, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5],
    "August": [5.0, 5.8, 6.5, 6.1, 5.2, 6.0, 6.8, 6.4, 5.6, 6.2, 5.9, 6.3, 6.7, 5.9, 6.2, 6.5, 6.8, 7.1, 7.4, 7.7],
    "September": [3.7, 4.9, 5.6, 5.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.9, 5.5, 4.7, 5.3, 5.0, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6, 5.8, 6.0, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6, 6.8],
    "October": [4.2, 5.4, 6.1, 5.7, 4.8, 5.6, 6.4, 6.0, 5.1, 3.7, 5.3, 5.8, 6.0, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6, 6.8, 7.0, 7.2, 7.4],
    "December": [1.3, 2.5, 3.2, 2.8, 1.9, 2.7, 3.5, 3.1, 2.3, 2.9, 2.1, 2.6, 3.0, 2.4, 2.7, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, 2.8, 2.2]
}
", and a test data........let's say "[1.3, 2.5, 3.2, 2.8, 1.9, 2.7, 3.5, 3.1, 2.3, 2.9, 2.1, 2.6, 3.0, 2.4, 2.7, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, 2.8, 2.2]". once we load the training data, it calculates the adaptive difference(which is the sum of consecutive difference of the terms ascending divided by the subtraction of the smallest difference from the biggest difference) for each key(month) in our dataset(training data). Then we'll add the adaptive difference for each key(month) to the original data thereby adjusting/training the dataset to accomodate values based on the nature/adaptive difference of the data. then to test/make the model make predictions, using the testdata and our trained/adjusted dataset, we'll calculate the mean of both the testdata and our trained/adjusted dataset and check which of keys(months) means is closest to the the test data mean. The closest becomes the predicted class. Do you understand now? if yes provide me with a new code implementing what i've explained and also a way to calculate error margin and accuracy for the predictions. let the name still be BeetleML and change some function names to align with blue-beetle-naming conventions/blue-beetle-related things/stuffs
